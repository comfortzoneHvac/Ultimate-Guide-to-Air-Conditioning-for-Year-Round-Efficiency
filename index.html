                <h2>Choosing the Right Cooling System</h2>
                <p>Selecting the perfect system depends on various factors, including your home’s size, layout, and specific cooling needs. Here are some common options:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Central Cooling</b>

                    <li><b>Ductless Mini-Split Systems</b>
                    <p> for homes without existing ductwork, these systems allow for zoned cooling. You can control the temperature in individual rooms, saving energy and enhancing comfort.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Window Units</b>
                    <p>A cost-effective solution for single rooms, window units are easy to install and great for temporary cooling needs.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Portable Units</b>
                    <p>Offering flexibility and convenience, portable units are an excellent choice for renters or those who need to cool specific areas temporarily.</p></li>

                    <li><b>Insufficient Cooling</b>
